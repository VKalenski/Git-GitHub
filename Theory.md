# **Git & GitHub - The Practical Guide**


### **What is Version Control?**

Saving & accessing data and tracking changes is what version control is all about. No matter if you're working on a private or a professional development project, code evolves, changes and continuously gets improved. A clean version management structure is therefore key to successfully manage the progress of your projects.

### **What is Git?**

Git is a 100% free version management tool, specifically created for and used by developers all over the world to manage project code history locally on their machines (Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix).

### **What is GitHub?**

GitHub is an online service, it is also free for many use cases (an account is all you need) and brings Git's local "file-tracking" strengths to the cloud. Storing project code online, updating code, accessing other team members' code or collaborating on large scale projects inside your organization - all possible with the help of GitHub!
